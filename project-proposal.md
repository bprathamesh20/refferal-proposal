# Project Proposal: Referr - A Professional Referral Platform

## Executive Summary

Referr is a innovative platform designed to connect job seekers with employees at top companies who can provide referrals. This platform aims to streamline the job application process, increase the chances of successful applications, and create a mutually beneficial ecosystem for job seekers and referrers.

## Problem Statement

Many qualified candidates struggle to get their applications noticed by top companies due to the high volume of applicants. Employee referrals are often the most effective way to get an application considered, but many job seekers lack the necessary connections. On the other hand, employees at these companies may be willing to refer qualified candidates but lack an efficient way to connect with them.

## Solution

Referr addresses these challenges by:

1. Providing a platform for job seekers to request referrals from employees at target companies.
2. Allowing employees to review referral requests and choose to support qualified candidates.
3. Facilitating the referral process with structured information exchange and status tracking.
4. Offering incentives for successful referrals, creating a win-win situation for all parties involved.

## Key Features

1. Company profiles with information about referral opportunities
2. Referral request submission system
3. Referral review and approval process for employees
4. Order tracking for referral requests
5. Notification system for updates on referral status
6. User profiles for both job seekers and referrers
7. Secure document handling for resumes and other application materials
8. Payment processing for referral fees

The job search and recruitment market is large and growing, with increased emphasis on networking and referrals. Referr taps into this trend by providing a structured platform for referrals, filling a gap between traditional job boards and professional networking sites.
